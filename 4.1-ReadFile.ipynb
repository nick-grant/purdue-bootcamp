I\\'ll write something up.\\n\\n       -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\\n\\nThe header lines were kept separate because they looked like mail\\nheaders and I have mailmode on.  The same thing applies to Bozo\\'s\\nquoted text.  Mailmode doesn\\'t screw things up very often, but since\\nmost people are usually converting non-mail, it\\'s off by default.\\n\\nParagraphs are handled ok.  In fact, this one is here just to\\ndemonstrate that.\\n\\nTHIS LINE IS VERY IMPORTANT!\\n(Ok, it wasn\\'t *that* important)\\n\\n\\nEXAMPLE HEADER\\n==============\\n\\nSince this is the first header noticed (all caps, underlined with an\\n\"=\"), it will be a level 1 header.  It gets an anchor named\\n\"section_1\".\\n\\nAnother example\\n===============\\nThis is the second type of header (not all caps, underlined with \"=\").\\nIt gets an anchor named \"section_1_1\".\\n\\nYet another example\\n===================\\n\\nThis header was in the same style, so it was assigned the same header\\ntag.  Note the anchor names in the HTML. (You probably can\\'t see them\\nin your current document view.)  Its anchor is named \"section_1_2\". \\nGet the picture?\\n\\n\\n\\n                    -- This is a custom header --\\n\\nYou can define your own custom header patterns if you know what your\\ndocuments look like.\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatures of HTML::TextToHTML\\n============================\\n\\n * Handles different kinds of lists\\n   1. Bulleted\\n   2. Numbered\\n      - You can nest them as far as you want.\\n      - It\\'s pretty decent about figuring out which level of list it\\n        is supposed to be on.\\n        - You don\\'t need to change bullet markers to start a new list.\\n   3. Lettered\\n      A. Finally handles lettered lists\\n      B. Upper and lower case both work\\n         a) Here\\'s an example\\n         b) I\\'ve been meaning to add this for some time.\\n      C. HTML without CSS can\\'t specify how ordered lists should be\\n        indicated, so it will be a numbered list in most browsers.\\n   4. Definition lists (see below)\\n * Doesn\\'t screw up mail-ish things\\n * Spots preformated text\\n\\n                 It just needs to have enough whitespace in the line.\\n        Surrounding blank lines aren\\'t necessary.  If it sees enough\\n        whitespace in a line, it preformats it.  How much is enough?\\n        Set it yourself at command line if you want.\\n\\n * You can append a file automatically to all converted files.  This\\n   is handy for adding signatures to your documents.\\n\\n * Deals with paragraphs decently.\\n\\n   Looks for short lines in the middle of paragraphs and keeps them\\n   short with the use of breaks (<BR>).  How short the lines need to\\n   be is configurable.\\n\\n   Unhyphenates split words that are in the middle of para-\\n   graphs.  Let me know if trailing punctuation isn\\'t handled \"prop-\\n   erly\".  It should be.\\n\\n   One can also have multi-paragraph list items, like this one.\\n\\n * Puts anchors at all headers and, if you\\'re using the mail header\\n   features, at the beginning of each mail message.  The anchor names\\n   for headings are based on guessed section numbers.  \\n   - You can turn off this option too, if you don\\'t like it.\\n\\n * Groks Mosaic-style \"formatted text\" headers (like the one below)\\n\\n * Can hyperlink things according to a dictionary file.\\n   The sample dictionary handles URLs like http://www.aigeek.com/ and\\n   <http://www.katspace.com/> and also shows how to do simpler\\n   things such as linking the word txt2html the first time it appeared.\\n * One can also use the link-dictionary to define custom tags, for\\n   example using the star character to indicate *italics*.\\n\\n * Recognises and parses tables of different types:\\n   o DELIM: A table determined by delimiters.\\n   o ALIGN: No need for fancy delimiters, this figures out\\n     a table by looking at the layout, the spacing of the cells.\\n   o BORDER: has a nice border around the table\\n   o PGSQL: the same format as Postgresql query results.\\n\\n * Also with XHTML!  Turn on the --xhtml option and it will ensure that\\n   all paragraphs and list items have end-tags, all tags are in\\n   lower-case, and the doctype is for XHTML.\\n\\nExample of short lines\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe\\'re the knights of the round table\\nWe dance whene\\'er we\\'re able\\nWe do routines and chorus scenes\\nWith footwork impeccable.\\nWe dine well here in Camelot\\nWe eat ham and jam and spam a lot.\\n\\nExample of varied formatting\\n----------------------------\\n\\nIf I want to *emphasize* something, then I\\'d use stars to wrap\\naround the words, *even if there were more than one*, *that\\'s*\\nwhat I\\'d do.  But I could also _underline_ words, so long as\\nthe darn thing was not a_variable_name, in which case I wouldn\\'t\\nwant to lose the underscores in something which thought it was\\nunderlining.  Though we might want to _underline more than one word_\\nin a sentence.  Especially if it is _The Title Of A Book_.\\nFor another kind of emphasis, let\\'s go and #put something in bold#.\\n   But it doesn\\'t even need to be that simple. Something which is *really\\nexciting* is coping with italics and similar things *spread across\\nmultiple lines*.\\n\\nExample of Long Preformatting\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n(extract from Let It Rain by Kristen Hall)\\n\\n\\tI have given, I have given and got none\\n\\tStill I\\'m driven by something I can\\'t explain\\n\\tIt\\'s not a cross, it is a choice\\n\\tI cannot help but hear his voice\\n\\tI only wish that I could listen without shame\\n\\n\\tLet it rain, let it rain, on me\\n\\tLet it rain, oh let it rain,\\n\\tLet it rain, on me\\n\\n\\tI have been a witness to the perfect crime\\n\\tWipe the grin off of my face to hide the pain\\n\\tIt isn\\'t worth the tears you cry\\n\\tTo have a perfect alibi\\n\\tNow I\\'m beaten at the hands of my own game\\n\\n\\tLet it rain, let it rain, on me\\n\\tLet it rain, oh let it rain,\\n\\tLet it rain, on me\\n\\nDefinition Lists\\n----------------\\n\\nA definition list comprises the following:\\n\\nTerm:\\n  The term part of a DL item is a word on a line by itself, ending\\nwith a colon.\\nDefinition:\\nThe definition part of a DL item is at least one paragraph following\\nthe term.\\n\\n  If one has more than one paragraph in the definition, the first line of\\nthe next paragraph needs to be indented two spaces from where the term\\nstarts, otherwise we don\\'t know that it belongs to the definition.\\n\\nExamples of Tables\\n------------------\\n\\nALIGN\\n~~~~~\\n\\nHere is a simple ALIGN table:\\n\\n    -e  File exists.\\n    -z  File has zero size.\\n    -s  File has nonzero size (returns size).\\n\\nHere are some of the conditions of ALIGN tables:\\n\\n  #Context:#  A table needs to be surrounded by blank lines.\\n   #Length:#  A table must contain at least two rows.\\n    #Width:#  A table must contain at least two columns.\\n  #Spacing:#  There needs to be at least two spaces between the columns,\\n              otherwise there might be some random paragraph which\\n              could have inter-word spacing that lined up by accident.\\n#Cell Size:#  If you have more than one line (as just above) then\\n              you will simply get empty cells where the other column is empty.\\n#Alignment:#  Alignment of cells is attempted to be preserved.\\n\\nBORDER\\n~~~~~~\\n\\nThis is a table with a border.\\n\\n\\t+---------+-----+\\n\\t| Food    | Qty |\\n\\t+---------+-----+\\n\\t| Bread   |   1 |\\n\\t| Milk    |   1 |\\n\\t| Oranges |   3 |\\n\\t| Apples  |   6 |\\n\\t+---------+-----+\\n\\nPGSQL\\n~~~~~~\\n\\nThis is the same table like Postgresql would make it.\\n\\n\\t Food    | Qty \\n\\t---------+-----\\n\\t Bread   |   1 \\n\\t Milk    |   1 \\n\\t Oranges |   3 \\n\\t Apples  |   6 \\n\\t(4 rows)\\n\\nDELIM\\n~~~~~\\n\\nA delimited table needs to have its delimiters at the start and end,\\njust to be sure that this is a table.\\n\\n:Fred:Nurk:58:\\n:George:Washington:62:\\n:Mary:Quant:35:\\n\\nAnd one can have almost any delimiter one wishes.\\n\\n| Darcy, Fitzwilliam | hero    |\\n| Bennet, Elizabeth  | heroine |\\n| Wickham, George    | villain |\\n\\nTHINGS TO DO\\n============\\n\\nThere are some things which this module doesn\\'t handle yet which\\nI would like to implement.\\n\\nA.
